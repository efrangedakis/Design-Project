    <p class="historytext">The NHL, founded in 1917 as the National Hockey Association and later rebranded, has grown into a premier professional ice hockey league in North America. Starting with four teams, the league expanded over the years to include franchises from both the United States and Canada. The NHL has witnessed legendary players and iconic moments, with teams like the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, and Boston Bruins contributing to its storied history. The Stanley Cup, awarded to the playoff champion, stands as a symbol of excellence in the sport. The league has faced challenges and undergone changes, but it remains a focal point of professional sports, captivating fans with its intense competition and showcasing top-tier talent.</p>

    <p class="draftrules">NHL draft rules govern the process by which teams select amateur players to join the league. The draft order is determined through a lottery system for non-playoff teams, with the remaining teams selecting in reverse order of their regular-season standings. Each team has a specified number of draft picks based on their performance and trades. Eligible players are typically between the ages of 18 and 20, and those not drafted can re-enter the following year. The draft consists of multiple rounds, and teams have a limited time to make their selections. Once drafted, players can choose to sign with the team that selected them or opt to return to amateur play. The NHL draft serves as a crucial mechanism for teams to acquire young talent and build their rosters for the future.</p>
